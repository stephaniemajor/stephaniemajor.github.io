    <div id="about">
      <p>Hi, I am Stephanie Major.</p>
      <p>I am a native French speaker who immigrated to the United States in 1998. I am an American citizen. I did a college degree in public accounting in Canada and my first job after college was in a CPA firm. After a few years, I moved on to corporate finance in the banking sector. When we immigrated to United States, I had an opportunity in the telecom sector in analysis and I took it. Then I had kids, two wonderful boys, and I stayed at home. I have been back on the job market since June 2014. Looking into the market and liking new challenges, I decided to become a software developer. But, I quickly realized that it wasn't for me.  I need more action, more social interactions. Prompted my by software mini experience, I decided to learn more about Product and Project Management. So, here I am learning and getting new skills that are inline with my personality and business experience.</p> 
  
      <h5><p>Education and Certification</p></h5>
  
      <ul class="education">
        <li>CPA registered in good standing in Michigan</li>
        <li>Canadian CPA (known as CA) in Quebec. Active until 2010</li>
        <li>BA, major in public accounting</li>
        <li>MBA, major in corporate finance, minor in international management from HEC (HEC is ranked 2nd in Canada)</li>
        <li>Certificate in translation - French/English</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h5><p>Interest and hobbies</p></h5>
  
      <p> I have so many! I love spending time with my family and friends. I like to travel, I like photography, reading, skiing, gardening, cooking. I am open to life and I am curious. I try a lots of things. I even tried trapeze although I am afraid of height. I must admit, I won't sign on jumping  off an airplane with a parachute anytime soon.... </p>
  
      <h5>DevBootCamp signature requirement!  - why not keeping this... Something quirky about me</h5>
      <p>I was the voice for French GPS commands in the Quebec market for a car manufacturer...well, I wasn't the main voice, I was the add-on voice...</p>
