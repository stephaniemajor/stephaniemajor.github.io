        <p>Hi, I am Stephanie Major.</p>
        <p>I have decided to make a career change. I did a college degree in public accounting in Canada and my first job after college was in a CPA firm. After a few years, I moved on to corporate finance in the banking sector. When we immigrated to United States, I had an opportunity in the telecom sector in analysis and I took it. Then I had kids, two wonderful boys, and I stayed at home. I have been back on the job market since June 2014. After careful consideration, I decided to become a developer. I am logical, focused, and looking forward to new challenges. So, here I am learning to become a developer at DevBootCamp.</p> 
        <h5><p>Education and Certification</p></h5>
        <ul class="education">
          <li>CPA regitered in good standing in Michigan</li>
          <li>Canadian CPA (known as CA) in Quebec. Active until 2010</li>
          <li>BA, major in public accounting</li>
          <li>MBA, major in corporate finance, minor in international management from HEC (HEC is ranked 2nd in Canada)</li>
          <li>Certificate in translation - French/English</li>
         </ul>
        <h5><p>Interest and hobbies</p></h5>
        <p> I have so many! I love spending time with my family and friends. I like to travel, I like photography, reading, skiing, gardening, cooking. I am open to life and I am curious. I try a lots of things. I even tried trapeze although I am afraid of height. I must admit, I won't sign on jumping  off an airplane with a parachute anytime soon.... </p>
        <h5><p>DevBootCamp signature requirement!   Something quirky about me</p></h5>
        <p>I was the voice for French GPS commands in the Quebec market for a car manufacturer...well, I wasn't the main voice, I was the add-on voice...</p>
