      <h2>CSS: Borders, margins, and padding</h2>
      <h3><time datetime="2016-01-18">January 18, 2016</time></h3>
      <p>My topic today about what I am learning to be a developer is about CSS. More precisely about borders, margins, and padding. </p>
     </header>

     <main>
      <h3>What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?</h3>

      <section class="main"> 
        <p>When using margin, the areas (you can visualize them as boxes) won’t be touching each other. It means that if you have a list shown as buttons, they will look apart from each other. A day to day analogy is withtownhouses vs houses. The townhouses don’t have margins on their left and right while the houses have margins everywhere. If we push it, we could say that apartments in a building don’t have any borders at all.</p>
        <p>When using padding, the writing inside the area/box won’t touch the border. If you give the same padding all around what is inside, what you have written will look centered. Following our housing comparison above, it would be the space between the inside walls and the outside walls. The latter would be the border. The furniture do not touch the outside wall.</p>
        <p>Last, the border. It gives appearance to the lines around the padding (thick or not, dotted line or not). Again, continuing our housing example, the border are the walls. Brick walls are thick, windows are transparent. Since the housing example is a little less adapted to explain borders, you may also think about Excel, where the borders work the same way than in CSS.</p>

        <p>That’s it for today!</p>
