      <section class="main"> 
        <p>First off, I need to warn you. I am no specialist and the explanations below reflect my current understanding of noSQL database and its environment. By no means, this should be used as a reference.</p>
        <p>NoSQL databases provides a way to store and retrieve data which cannot be kept into a tabular relations used in relational databases.</p>
        <p>NoSQL systems are also sometimes called "Not only SQL" because they may support SQL-like query languages. At first, they were called "non SQL" or "non relational” databases.</p>
        <p>It has been around for quite sometimes but it is with the coming of Big Data and real-time applications that there popularity and use became quite important. The structure of NoSQL databases is more adapted to the need of Big Data and real time apps because the data can no longer reside onto one computer but is distributed amongst several machines interconnected (referred as clusters of machines).</p>
        <p>It is said that NoSQL database design is simpler and permits finer control over availability of machines. therefore, it does favor availability of machines, continuance of process even if  there is a communication errors between machines, and speed over consistency. Consistency means that the data created is valid in a sense that it follows all the rules within the database. Instead, most NoSQL databases offer a concept of "eventual consistency" in which database changes are propagated to all machines "eventually" (typically within milliseconds) so queries for data might not return updated data immediately or might result in reading data that is not accurate.</p>
        <p>From Wikipedia, I got this regarding types of NoSQL databases:</p>
        <p>“There have been various approaches to classify NoSQL databases, each with different categories and subcategories, some of which overlap. A basic classification based on data model, with examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Column: Accumulo, Cassandra, Druid, HBase, Vertica</li>
          <li>Document: Apache CouchDB, Clusterpoint, Couchbase, DocumentDB, HyperDex, Lotus Notes, MarkLogic, MongoDB, OrientDB, Qizx, RethinkDB</li>
          <li>Key-value: Aerospike, CouchDB, Dynamo, FairCom c-treeACE, FoundationDB, HyperDex, MemcacheDB, MUMPS, Oracle NoSQL Database, OrientDB, Redis, Riak</li>
          <li>Graph: Allegro, InfiniteGraph, MarkLogic, Neo4J, OrientDB, Virtuoso, Stardog</li>
          <li>Multi-model: Alchemy Database, ArangoDB, CortexDB, FoundationDB, MarkLogic, OrientDB”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Again from Wikipedia: </p>
        <p>Most “…NoSQL databases lack ability to joins in queries There are three main techniques for handling relational data in a NoSQL database.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Multiple queries</li>
          <p>Instead of retrieving all the data with one query, it's common to do several queries to get the desired data. NoSQL queries are often faster than traditional SQL queries so the cost of having to do additional queries may be acceptable. If an excessive number of queries would be necessary, one of the other two approaches is more appropriate.</p>
          <li>Caching/replication/non-normalized data</li>
          <p>Instead of only storing foreign keys, it's common to store actual foreign values along with the model's data. For example, each blog comment might include the username in addition to a user id, thus providing easy access to the username without requiring another lookup. When a username changes however, this will now need to be changed in many places in the database. Thus this approach works better when reads are much more common than writes.</p>
          <li>Nesting data</li>
          <p>With document databases like MongoDB it's common to put more data in a smaller number of collections. For example, in a blogging application, one might choose to store comments within the blog post document so that with a single retrieval one gets all the comments. Thus in this approach a single document contains all the data you need for a specific task.”</p>
        </ol>        
        <p>I personally realize that noSQL databases are very important and, considering our data centric world, is here to stay. Will there be evolution of it? I am sure,….. but for now, it seems to be doing what it should.</p>
        <p>That’s it for today!</p>
