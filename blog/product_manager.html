        <p>My topic today is about the role of a product Manager. </p>        <p>The Product Manager (PM) is responsible for the strategy, roadmap, and feature definition for that product. In other words, the PM is responsible for the why, what, and when of the product.</p>
        <p>I have taken an online course with Udemy about product management. Most likely one of the best online course I have taken. There was a lot of information and I will try to synthesize to the max what I understand a PM should be and should do to be successful and bring value to the product. </p>
        <p>First, the PM doesn’t use his/her gut feeling, instead, uses all the info and data gathered to make a decision on the why, what, and when. To be able to do that, the PM looks into several areas. For examples: customer needs/demands, competition, industry trends, customer satisfaction, adoption, retention, referrals given, revenue generated, product quality, roadblocks in developing the product/feature, company’s goals regarding the product, and so on. This requires lots of meetings/listening/follow-ups. It can be done by interviews, internet searches, using metrics, team meetings, etc. With this info on hand, the PM knows if his decisions up until now made sense for the team, product and company’s goal or if changes need to be made.</p>
        <p>The PM is kind of a “pivot person” if I may say because he/she is interacting with several areas of a business as well as with external stakeholders. It is the responsibility of the PM to speak the same language than his/her counterpart to make sure messages back and forth are fully understood. This might require the PM to acquire some technical jargon in different areas (legal, marketing, sales, customer services, engineering, programming) or even a minimum of technical skills.</p>
        <p>The PM duties encompasses the following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Product Development – work on specs & wire framing, adjust target in line with technical difficulties or external factors</li>
          <li>Analysis – competition, metrics</li>
          <li>Research –market trends, competitors, user needs/demands</li>
          <li>Follow up on the product, reviews, news, social medias, feedback</li>
          <li>Product Planning – interact during sprint meetings about what is coming up and get engineer’s feedback and input. Estimate and scope further out.</li>
          <li>Customer Development </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the online class, the research/follow up was estimated as taking 60% of the PM’s time. I wonder if this is specific to the B2C sector…</p>
        <p>That’s it for today!</p>
