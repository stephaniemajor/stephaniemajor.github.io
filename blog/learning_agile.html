      <p>My topic today is about AGILE. </p>

      <section class="main"> 
        <p>I was a bit familiar with AGILE and SCRUM because I have lots of friends in software development and I heard bits and pieces here and there. Being surrounded by them is the main reason I thought of going into programming in the first place…</p>
        <p>I started to watch videos on AGILE presentations. I took online courses, one for Project Management and one for Product Management and decided on other courses I should do. I also read lots of info on the web, participated to an AGILE Coffee session, registered to a back to back SCRUM and Product Owner seminar leading to a certification coming this May, and started a book on implementing AGILE where waterfall used to be the norm.</p>
        <p>I learned that AGILE is a methodology not to be confounded with SCRUM which is an AGILE approach. The other AGILE approaches are Kanban and Extreme Programing (XP). Therefore, we do not talk about “sprint” in AGILE, since a sprint is singular to the SCRUM approach. I will read about Kanban and Extreme Programing (XP) later on…</p>
        <p>What caught my attention is that AGILE has adopted the LEAN philosophy. LEAN philosophy is about doing the minimum to get a viable yet attractive product/feature. The goal is to deliver quickly to get on the market while the market is hot or still green/unpenetrated or to make sure it will work out before spending too much resources in it. Wow, once I understood that, all the prior information I got about AGILE made sense.</p>
        <p>I learned that AGILE has a “bible” called the AGILE MANIFESTO. </p>
        <p>The AGILE MANIFESTO’s values are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
          <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
          <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
          <li>Responding to change over following a plan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The AGILE MANIFESTO’s principles are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Highest priority is customer satisfaction</li>
          <li>Welcome changing requirements</li>
          <li>Frequent delivery of software</li>
          <li>Business people & developers cooperating daily</li>
          <li>Build projects around motivated people</li>
          <li>Face-to-face conversation is best</li>
          <li>Progress measured by working software</li>
          <li>Sustainable development pace</li>
          <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence</li>
          <li>Simplicity</li>
          <li>Self-organizing teams</li>
          <li>Regular reflection & adaptation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That’s it for today!</p>
