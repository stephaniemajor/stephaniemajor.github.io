      <h2>Ruby vs JavaScript</h2>
      <h3><time datetime="2016-02-12">February 12, 2016</time></h3>
      <p>My topic today is about Ruby and JavaScript. I will raise a few differences I have noticed between these two programming languages. </p>

      <section class="main"> 
        <p>What I realized me at first is the need to declare a variable in JavaScript. We do not need to do this in Ruby, most likely because Ruby is a more recent language.</p>
        <p>I noticed the need to use semi-colon at the end of a line for JavaScript while these are foregone in Ruby.</p>
        <p>In Ruby, we talk about a hash while in JavaScript, we talk about an object. The terminology of their parts is a bit different but they basically work the same way. For example, a key in Ruby is called a property in JavaScript but their value is called value in both languages.</p>
        <p>The one thing that really caught my attention is the for loop in JavaScript. How do I love the structure! It is built on one line in three parts. The first part initializes the loop. The second part gives the point where the loop should stop, and the last part updates the state. It is written this way: </p>  
        <p><code>for (var triangle = "#"; triangle.length <= #; triangle += "#")</code></p>
        <p>Up until now, reading about JavaScript has been more difficult than reading about Ruby. I am hoping though, that we can build on our knowledge of the Ruby language to be successful in writing code in JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Thatâ€™s it for today!</p>
