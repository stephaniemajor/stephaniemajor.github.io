        <h2>Code Programming - Moving on...</h2>
        <h3><time datetime="2016-03-20">March 20, 2016</time></h3>
        <p>My topic today is about me...I have decided to drop the idea of software development. </p>
        <p>In December 2015, I started the Phase 0 of Devbootcamp. Phase 0 is the 9 weeks long online part of the program. I did it while I was working.  I was doing over 30 hours a week with Phase 0. I learned HTML, CSS, Ruby, JavaScript, and SQL. I learned about classes, DOM and so much more. Again, on top of my job, where I was wrapping up projects and making sure my client would be fine without me once I left (the A/R Manager was sick with stress because I was leaving and ended up in the hospital – poor guy). On top of  Phase 0 and the job, I was also stacking up the freezer and refrigerator with food for my family because, starting Feb 29th, I was going to be gone, gone 6 days a week from 8 am until 10 pm for 9 weeks. This is the boot camp. And ….. I was also trying to do more in the house and for the kids (like driving them to their afterschool activities) because my husband would be kind of a single dad for 9 weeks. So, was I enjoying learning to code? No, but I put it on the fact that I was handling too much at the same time. </p>
        <p>Then, I started Phase 1 at Devbootcamp and realized I wasn’t in it. I decided to stop after a week. I took a week off and got back to it. No use, I don’t see myself doing it. My friends concur, I would have been a good programmer because I am logical and focused, but programming might be too focused and slow for someone “with a vibrant personality” like mine. </p>
        <p>So, I dropped the program. I learned a lot though.  By no means am I a good programmer, but I read code, I know the techniques, the struggles, how to figure out a solution to a problem using code. I feel I can take a C#, Python, Scala book, read it through and be able to read that code too. Devbootcamp gave us this ability and I am thankful for it. </p>
        <p> What should I do next? My original plan was to do 3-5 years of programming and move on to a Product Manager role due to my personality and experience. </p>
        <p> When I told of my decision to my friends, one of them said “Do you know AGILE?  No one REALLY does it - so if you take a class you will know the buzzwords - and that will be all you need.” That picked my curiosity. </p>
        <p>That’s it for today!</p>
