  <li>What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?</li>
    <p>I learned this is a way to make things visually appealing, especially when the content is shown in “box”. For example, using the margin, the boxes won’t be touching each other. Using the padding, the writing inside the box won’t touch the border and the border gives appearance to the lines shaping the box (thick or not, dotted line or not). The border in CSS works the same way than in Excel (although, there are more possibilities in Excel. </p>
  <li>	What did you learn about CSS positioning?</li>
    <p>The best way to learn about position is to play with it. I read about them in a book when Codecademy was down and I thought I understood well. Huummm … no. I played with the position relative, fixed, absolute and got a better understanding. There are four positioning status:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>	Static: each elements sit on each other</li>
        <li>	Relative: the elements move in relation to each other (like scrolling down a Word document)</li>
        <li>	Absolute. The element just stay there, no matter where the other elements are</li>
        <li>Fixed: it is a type of absolute positioning. Even if you scroll up or down, you will see exactly at the same place on your screen.</li>
      </ol>
  <li>	What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?</li>
    <p>I don’t think anything was easy in here. It was difficult, overwhelming to start. I found it difficult to find what to do on my own. I had to refer to Codecademy a lot. Even then, it did not come out how I wanted. I did extra research and found my solution in pxp only. I revealed the code of a page where it had what I wanted. Oh my!.  I ended up doing more than 4 hours on the default css to notice that I was supposed to do the blog too in the solo assignment. Oops.<p>
  <li>	What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?</li>
    <p>HTML and CSS are night and day. HTML is logical. CSS is more intuitive. It is an art to be a good UX designer. It must require quite a bit of experience and patience to get there.</p>
