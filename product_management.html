      <p>On this page, I explored where a Product Manager should show strength and I put it in perspective of my significant business experience, looking for examples that highlight these qualities.</p>
      <p>In addition, I am enrolled in a training during the week of May 16th 2016 to become a certified SCRUM Master and Product Owner </p>
      <h3>Prioritizing</h3>
        <p>A Product Manager has to juggle with the many different aspects of the job, all at the same time, therefore the need to prioritize and organize the day efficiently. Here are some examples where my job “pulled me in all sorts of directions” and I managed.</p>
        <p><i>WD-40 Company</i></p>
        <p>I had to wear many hats during my 40 hours a week. I had to cover for illnesses, vacations, or long term leave. The desks were Merchandise returns, Collection, Credit, A/R Manager, Merchandises deductions. When I had to cover four desks at the same time here is how I prioritized:  </p>
          <ul class="education">
            <li>Employees coming for questions or discussion were my priority.</li>
            <li>The orders on hold were released 4 times a day.</li>
            <li>I monitored and responded to emails from all inboxes in the morning.</li>
            <li>The credit applications were done the day they were received.</li>
            <li>Merchandise returns requests from carriers were done right away. The customers’ requests were done the day the request was received or the next.</li>
            <li>All contacts pertaining to the A/R Manager function were dealt according to the urgency.</li>
            <li>Collection efforts were done for customers presenting a collection risk only.</li>
            <li>The reports would be done only if I had a deadline to meet.</li>
            <li>The credit reviews, procedures, and job descriptions were not dealt with during these times.</li>
          </ul>
      
        <p><i>T-Mobile</i></p>    
        <p>When I was Manager of Strategic Analysis, I had to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Perform economic and customer behavior assessments of marketing endeavors and business projects/initiatives. </li>
            <li>Prepare reports for customer behavior, including scores and segmentation. I presented findings and recommendations weekly.</li>
            <li>Evaluate and test data mining tools.</li>    
            <li>At one point, I started investigating the possibility to buy demographic data (budget needed, integration with our data), and tested its reliability with a test sample. We ended up buying it. </li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Talking to users</h3>
        <p>A Product Manager gets feedback as part of assessing the best features of a product or tool.  In order to do so, the Product Manager must demonstrate good listening skills and take in the hints.</p>
        <p><i>WD-40 Company</i></p>
          <p>I understood that the Director of A/R was missing some info to assess risk. I asked him what would be his ideal report and why. I did a couple of wireframes. Then, created the report which became a standard. </p>

        <p><i>T-Mobile</i></p>  
          <p>When I was a Senior Financial Analyst, I was part of a department that could be considered as internal consulting.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In meetings, I listened to the questions asked by the directors of various departments. At one point, I realized that the VP of Business Operations lacked information. Information we were able to provide. I designed reports and created them with Business Objects. I made a few changes according to her requests.</li>
              <li>Every time a director would ask for a Microsoft Excel model, I would sit down with this requester and asked several questions: What info the model should provide? Could I see the reports that were done with the information? What was the purpose of these reports? What decisions were taken based on these reports? How the requester had been working without a model up until now? Could I see the requester’s worksheets? What are the parameters that could change? Who would use it?  etc. My goal was to make sure I would create a model that: 1) provided the needed info; 2) was easy to use for them; 3) was visually appealing; 4) was flexible and re-usable.</li>
            </ul>

      <h3>Giving feedback</h3>
        <p>A Product Manager must be able to clearly communicate the demand as well as the nature of a problem/bug.</p>
        <p><i>WD-40 Company</i></p>
          <p>We were missing information to file claims with carriers regarding merchandise returned. I informed the logistic manager and the inventory manager of our problem. We did a conference call with the warehouse managers from whom we should get the info. I told them what we were doing with the information they currently provided us and asked if it would be possible for them to provide the extra information we needed. This meant a change in the way they were doing business. With negotiation, we ended up modifying the requirement to make it easier for them. We agreed to try it for six months and then reconvene. After the conference call, I sent a recap email with a sample of a report laying out the needed info, welcoming any changes or questions.</p>
        <p><i>T-Mobile</i></p> 
          <p>I was selected to represent the analyst community of several departments (accounting, business ops, strategic analysis, marketing, supply chain) for the implementation of a new data warehouse. In these meetings, I would inform which data was needed, the frequency required, the details needed. I would also provide examples of why this data was needed.</p>

      <h3>Acquiring data to make decisions</h3>
        <p>A Product Manager is kind of a researcher, in a sense that he or she has to find data to have a better grasp of what the product/feature should provide and look like in order to be well positioned in the market and successful.</p>
        <p><i>Credit Lyonnais Canada and TD Bank</i></p>
          <p> An important part of my job as an analyst was to research in the following areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Competition: Who were the competitors, their strengths and weaknesses and how the client compared with them?</li>
            <li>Industry: Was the client operating in a cyclical industry? If so, when did the down cycle start? Was there a lot of competitors? What was the client market share? etc</li>
            <li>International market: If the client had an international presence, how dependent is the client on the international market? Which regions? How are the exchange rates? Stable or not? Does the client need protection against currency fluctuations? How is the political status in the international market?</li>  
            <li>Suppliers: How many? Is there a dependence? etc.</li>
           </ul>

        <p><i>T-Mobile</i></p> 
        <p>I created a model to predict weekly churn. I included in my model data from several departments. Here are a few examples. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wait time to get to a customer care representative</li>
            <li>Marketing campaign made by T-Mobile in each market</li>
            <li>Marketing campaign made by competitors in each market</li>
            <li>Impact of seasons</li>
          </ul>


      <h3>Working with different departments</h3>
        <p>A Product Manager works with several departments and need to speak their language. From these interactions, the Product Manager gets ideas, insights, info on roadblocks and delays, a better vision of goals, empowerment,  etc.</p>
        <p><i>WD-40 Company</i></p>
          <p>I initiated drafting and creating a formal policy in regards to returned merchandise. I first researched what was done in the industry, then I worked with business operations, sales, and quality assurance departments to create a policy that would be manageable and fitting everybody. When we reached a satisfactory policy, I had it reviewed by all of the VPs of these organizations and the President of the Americas. The latter, at my request, distributed the policy at large, so to ensure prompt acceptance and adherence.</p>

        <p><i>T-Mobile</i></p> 
          <p>I gathered requirements from several departments: accounting, strategic analysis, marketing, business operations, and supply chain. I was representing these departments for the data warehouse project. Through experience and discussions, I was able to make a case why certain data (features) were needed, so the departments I represented would be able to get the data needed for their analytics and for their reports.</p>

      <h3>Improving efficiency</h3>
        <p><i>WD-40 Company</i></p>
          <p>I was, at first, hired to cover the merchandise returns function. But I couldn’t do just that. I wrote procedures and a cheat sheet. By researching the purpose of the steps and entries and how it would translate cost or revenue wise, I found out a few ways to recoup some expenses. I do not have the financial impact because the ERP would not report on the recuperated cost, but we know it was there.  </p>

        <p><i>T-Mobile</i></p>
          <p>When I was a supervisor of roam accounting, I realized that with the purchase of two competitors, bigger than T-Mobile itself, the process using MS Excel was going to be a burden. I had learned Microsoft Access on my own and decided to create an Access database. I created the needed queries as well, so the month end process became much more automated and provided us with the capability to provide even more info.</p>
