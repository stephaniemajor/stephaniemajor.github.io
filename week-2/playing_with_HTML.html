  I am trying to conquer my fear of doing a webpage by myself. It is very difficult. My brain is not trained this way.
  </p>
  <h2> Problems encountered </h2>
    <ul>
          <li> I am having difficulty to copy an image in my file editor.</li>
          <li> online serach failed. My problem is my non knowledge of how to work with an editor - hubby helped </li>
          <li> I didn't know how to see the result of what I have done so far. </li>
          <li> searched online </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>I went home and saw what address I used to get the blog up</li>
        <li>it worked</li>
        <li>next I saw I couldn't see my image</li>
    </ol>
