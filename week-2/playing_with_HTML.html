  I am trying to conquer my fear of doing a webpage by myself. It is very difficult. My brain is not trained this way.

  <h2> Problems encountered </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> I am having difficulty to copy an image in my file editor.</li>
          <li> online serach failed. My problem is my non knowledge of how to work with an editor - hubby helped </li>
      <li> I didn't know how to see the result of what I have done so far. 
        <li> searched online </li>
