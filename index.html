      <section>    
        <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>Ah! but it is not finished yet... I am working on bits and pieces at a time.</p>
        <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Stephanie. I am a CPA/MBA fluent in English and French. I moved from Seattle to San Diego with my family in 2014.</p>
        <p>I am this high energy, well organized, driven, and resourceful person. A natural leader, I seek to build synergies within a team and throughout an organization to reach a common goal: success in a healthy work environement.</p>
        <p>I have a lot of experience and invite you to visit my About page to find more details about me and my background.</p>
        <p>I am currently seeking a new opportunity in the Project Management or Product Management space.</p>
        <p>Project Management is a natural area for me. I am so organized in my personal life and at work, I follow goals and get things done. Once a manager said, if we give it to Stephanie, it will get done. Another characteristic making me a good candidate is how I take care of my team. I provide help and support to make sure everybody gets what they need to be successful.  I feel those around me appreciate me for that. </p>
        <p>Product Management/Business Analysis is the area that would tap into my business experience. I have a feeling I would be of tremendous value for a company in that position. I understand several aspects of a business. My jobs in a CPA firm, a bank, at T-Mobile, in a B2B startup, and lately in a consumer goods sector, exposed me to several industries, business models, and systems. All my jobs had different systems and products. Systems and products I needed to learn and use, with their strength or flaws.  I know what it is to be a user, therefore, I know how to talk their language. As an analyst, I had the chance to work with different departments. I worked with IT, marketing, business operations, customer care, engineeering, and legal departments. I also had several face to face meetings with C-suite execs and made presentations to small or large audiences. I know how to talk to several kinds of people due to my community volunteering (survey, teaching, training, and more).</p>
