        <p class="welcome">Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>Ah! but it is not finished yet... I am working on bits and pieces at a time.</p>
        <p>I am this high energy, well organized, driven, and resourceful person who loves working with others, loves to make sure all work in synergy with each others in search of a common goal: success in a healthy work environement.</p>
        <p>I am a well rounded with lots of experience. Why? Because I am open to new challenges and prefer to be in a place where I could provide the most benefit. I invite you to visit the About page where you will find more details about me and my background.</p>
        <p>I am currently seeking a new opportunity. Naturally, I thought of going back to wireless but I realized that I am not as attractive as I used to be because I was a stay at home mom when the Big Data got big.  Where should I go next then? I have looked into it and I believe I could be either as a Project Manager or as a Product Manager.</p>
        <p>Project Management is a natural area for me. I am so organized in my personal life and at work, I follow goals and get things done. Once a manager said, if we give it to Stephanie, it will be done. Yep, that is me. I am also a natural leader and I like to help people get what they need to be successful and accomplished and I feel those around me appreciate me for that. </p>
        <p>Product Management/Business Analysis is the area that would tap into my business experience. I have a feeling I would be of tremendous value for a company in this position. I understand several aspects of a business. My jobs in a CPA firm, a bank, at T-Mobile, in a B2B startup, and lately in a consumer goods sector, exposed me to several industries, business models, and systems. All my jobs had different systems and products, systems and products I needed to learn and use, with their strength or with their flaws.  I know what it is to be a user, therefore, I know how to talk their language. As an analyst, I had the chance to work with different departments. I worked with IT, marketing, business operations, customer care, engineeering, and legal departments. I also had several face to face meetings with C-suite execs and made presentations to small or large audiences.I know how to talk to several kinds of people due to my community volunteering (survey, teaching, training, and more).</p>
